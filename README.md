# ThreeJSExperiments

These are some Experiments ive made with Three.Js, Music and Blender.

Ive used all kind of functions, prost processing and controls of Three.js to get the most out of it and learn all kinds of it's features.

PS: Some of them wont work because of the missing files like HDR files, Images, Textures and so on. The Music can be changed to your own.

A little Project I made after i did a Mediajam with a friend of mine. We were able to create a little VR Art installation and I got inspired to do such a thing on my own but in the browser. This should also be VR compatible with the integrated Three.js Library.
You are able to fly around on this Map but it has no collision detection or such... This Map is inspired by PS1 games with an eery Atmosphere like silent hill.

Here is also a short Video i made by writing a Javascript function that changes the Euler Radius and XYZ Position of the Camera every few seconds.
